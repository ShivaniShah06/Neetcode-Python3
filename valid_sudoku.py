# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Note:

# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

# Output: false
# Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

# Solution reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjFXEUCMqI8&t=618s
# Summary of solution: Create hashmaps to store values in each column, row, and square (use row//3, column//3 as keys to store squares of size 3x3). Use 2 for loops to
# iterate through the board and compare values to column, row, and square hashmaps to return true or false
