# IMPORTANT FACTS

## **IMPORTS**

- `from collections import Counter`
   - If you use this as `counter = Counter(<list_of_int>)` it returns a dictionary with the values in the list as keys and its frequency in the list as values

## **Dictionary**
- Dictionary cannot have anything that it mutable as its key
- defaultdict (from collections import defaultdict) are almost same except for the fact that defaultdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does not exists
